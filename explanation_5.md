Used linked list, since it can be traversed backwards and has the attribute of immutability. 

Time Complexity:
As for the time complexity, being a linked list in its core structure, it has:

    append: O(1)
    search: O(n)
    size: O(n)
    to_list: O(n)

Space complexity:

<<<<<<< HEAD:explanation_5.md.txt
Since it depends on the number of nodes of BlockChain, which results in O(n).
=======
In respect to space complexity, it is directly dependant on the number of nodes our BlockChain incorporates, 
resulting in O(n).
