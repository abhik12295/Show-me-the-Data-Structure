Used linked list, since it can be traversed backwards and has the attribute of immutability. 

Time Complexity:
As for the time complexity, being a linked list in its core structure, it has:

    append: O(1)
    search: O(n)
    size: O(n)
    to_list: O(n)

Space complexity:

Since it depends on the number of nodes of BlockChain, which results in O(n).
