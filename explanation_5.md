This project is based on the creation of a linked list, though, in this case the list is traversed backwards and 
has the attribute of inmutability. 
This has provoked, that some of the methods developed during the course for linked list are not available for the 
Blockchain list:
    prepend
    remove
    pop
    insert

Time Complexity:
As for the time complexity, being a linked list in its core structure, it has:

    append: O(1)
    search: O(n)
    size: O(n)
    to_list: O(n)

Space complexity:

In respect to space complexity, it is directly dependant on the number of nodes our BlockChain incorporates, 
resulting in O(n).
